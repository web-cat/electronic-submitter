Web-CAT Electronic Submitter Version History
============================================

1.0.2 (2010-08-27):

 * Internal change: Calling `Submitter.setLongRunningTaskManager()` with a
   `null` argument is now a shortcut that reverts that instance of the
   submitter to the default long-running task behavior.


1.0.1 (2010-05-14):

 * Internal change: Removed a reference to a chained exception constructor so
   that the submitter is source-compatible with Java 1.5, not just Java 1.6.


1.0.0 (2010-03-02):

 * Initial release. This library is a refactoring of the code that was
   previously part of the Eclipse submitter plug-ins, so that it can be used in
   other applications and environments.
